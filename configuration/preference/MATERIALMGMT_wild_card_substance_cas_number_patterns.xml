               <preference name="MATERIALMGMT_wild_card_substance_cas_number_patterns" type="String" array="true" disabled="false" protectionScope="Site" envEnabled="false">
      <preference_description>Specifies the pattern of Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) numbers that indicates which substances will skip the in-built validation.
Also specifies which characters to include as wild cards in the pattern.
You can include multiple patterns as the value for this preference. To do this, add each pattern on a new line.


The various pattern characters include:
Asterisk  (*): Matches the preceding character (or set of characters) for 0 or more times.
Plus      (+): Repeat the preceding character (or set of characters) one or more times
Pipe      (|): Matches any one element from a list of elements, separated by the vertical bar (|).
Wildcard  (.): Represents any other symbol.
Optional  (?): Specifies that the preceding character may or may not be present in the string to be matched.
caret     (^): Specifies that the match must start at the beginning of the string or line.
dollar    ($): Specifies that the match must occur at the end of the string or before \n at the end of the line or string.
Brackets ([]): Matches any single character in a set of characters. By default, the match is case sensitive.
Negation([^]): Matches any single character that is not in a set of characters. By default, the match is case sensitive.
Character range ([first-last] ): Matches any single character in the range from the first to the last.
Grouping Characters (): Specifies a set of different symbols of a regular expression can be grouped together to act as a single unit.
\number : Allows a previously matched sub-expression(expression captured or enclosed within circular brackets ) to be identified subsequently in the same regular expression
Character classes- Matches any one of a set of characters. It is used to match the most basic element of a language like a letter, a digit, space, a symbol etc
/s : Matches any whitespace characters such as a space or a tab
/S : Matches any non-whitespace characters
/d : Matches any digit character
/D : Matches any non-digit characters
/w : Matches any word character (basically alpha-numeric)
/W : Matches any non-word character
/b : Matches any word boundary (this would include spaces, dashes, commas, semi-colons, etc).


Example 1:
If you specify ?7439.*.? as the value of the preference and the CAS number of a substance is 7439-92-1, the system skips the in-built validation for this substance.
This is because ?.*.? finds all character sequences with prefix 7439 and skips the validation for these substances.

Example 2:
If you specify 7787(-57-7|-59-9|-63-5) as the value of the preference and the CAS number of a substance is 7439-57-7 or 7439-59-9 or 7439-63-5, the system skips the in-built validation for this substance.
This is because &quot;|&quot; matches any one element from (-57-7|-59-9|-63-5).</preference_description>
