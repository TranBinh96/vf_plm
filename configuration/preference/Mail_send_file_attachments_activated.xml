      <preference_description>Activates sending dataset attachments as email file attachments. This takes effect when the envelope functionality sends messages directly to an email address instead of a Teamcenter user. When the mail is sent to a Teamcenter user, this preference has no impact, and the user always receives links to the envelope object.
Valid Values:
* true: Activates sending dataset attachments as email file attachments. The external recipient can open the attached files without requiring a Teamcenter logon or privileges. Consider site security guidelines before setting this preference to true.
* false: Deactivates sending dataset attachments as email file attachments. External recipients of emails receive only Teamcenter client links to the attached datasets and not the actual files.</preference_description>
