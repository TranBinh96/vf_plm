      <preference_description>Defines the Process types for which the allocated time calculation will ignore flows and will interpret the sub-processes or operations in sequence defined by the find number.
For these types, the allocated time will be computed identically to the work time. The line balancing chart will only show children of processes of this type.
Valid values are the internal name of the type Process (MEProcess) and any of its sub-types.</preference_description>
