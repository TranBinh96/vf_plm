               <preference name="Transient_Volume_RootDir" type="String" array="true" disabled="false" protectionScope="Site" envEnabled="true">
      <preference_description>Specifies the transient volume&apos;s root directory. This preference accepts multiple values to support a UNIX/Windows heterogeneous site. FMS takes the first value which is valid for the platform, UNIX or Windows; the validity check is simply the presence or absence of a backslash (\) character. Environment variable settings override this FCC configuration file setting. Transient volumes are file locations to which TcServer processes have direct access. These locations are typically used for server side file generation operations such as PLM XML files. Files within transient volumes are typically generated by the TcServer, read by a client (usually) once, then deleted.This preference is set during the initial database population. Its value should not be changed, even if several other Teamcenter installations point to the same pre-populated database.
Valid Values:
Accepts multiple values, in order to support a UNIX/Windows heterogeneous site. For example:
Transient_Volume_RootDir=
C:\temp
/tmp
You cannot define the path as a UNC path, for example, \\server\shared-transient-folder. You must use a direct path location. This is partly due to the fact that some ZIP archive utilities do not accept UNC paths, resulting in failure of exports to Microsoft Excel or Word.</preference_description>
