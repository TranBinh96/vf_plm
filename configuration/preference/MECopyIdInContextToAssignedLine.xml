      <preference_description>Determines if the in-context ID is copied to the assigned line during an assignment operation. When this preference is set to True, you do not have to expand a target structure before performing an accountability check or when using the Find in Other Panel menu command.
Valid Values:
True - The in-context ID is copied to the assigned line during an assignment operation. If no in-context ID is present, Teamcenter creates one and then copies it.
False - The in-context ID is not copied (even if one is present) to the assigned line during an assignment operation.</preference_description>
