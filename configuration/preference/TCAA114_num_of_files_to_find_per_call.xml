      <preference_description>Through this option it is possible to limit the number of files to be searched by file name. If the number of files to be searched in a single operation exceeds the number specified in this option, multiple SOA calls will be performed. Searches by file name are typically executed in order to reconnect non-managed files to datasets already stored in Teamcenter (e.g. via TCAA COM API).
Possible values:
- 0 or any negative number: all the files involved in the operation are searched with a single SOA call.
- Any positive number: this will be the maximum number of files searched by file name in a single SOA call.
The default value is: 500.</preference_description>
