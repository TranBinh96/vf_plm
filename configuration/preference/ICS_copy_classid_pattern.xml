      <preference_description>Determines the pattern of a class ID when a class is copied. All classes in Classification have unique identifiers. When performing a copy of a class (hierarchy), users must enter a new class ID for all classes to be copied. These new class IDs can also be automatically generated for one class or for all classes of a hierarchy. Use this preference to determine the pattern of class IDs when the classes are copied.
Valid Values:
Any single string value, used alone or in conjunction with the following placeholders:
${P} - Represents the class ID of the parent class.
${NNN} - Represents a three digit numerical sequence. Any number of digits can be defined.
${CID} - Represents the original class ID when a class is copied.

For example, ${CID}${NNN} generates SourceID000, where SourceID is the original class ID and 000 is the next iterative number.
Another example, ${NNNN} generates 0000, where 00000 is the next iterative number.
Another example, ${P}_${NNN} generates Parent_000, where Parent is the name of the parent class and 000 is the next iterative number.
Another example, ${CID}.new generates SourceID.new, where SourceID is the original class ID, suffixed by .new.</preference_description>
