      <preference_description>Through this option it is possible to limit the number of levels traversed to retrieve &quot;where referenced&quot; hierarchies. 
When the structure to be traversed is deeply nested, a single SOA call operation may take long time to complete leaving the application hanging for too much time. 
If the number of levels to be traversed for a specified operation exceeds the number specified in this option, multiple SOA calls will be performed. As an example, this option is taken into consideration when retrieving the folder hierarchy to reach current default folder.
Possible values:
- 0 or any negative number: all the files involved in the operation are searched with a single SOA call.
- Any positive number: this will be the maximum number of files searched by file name in a single SOA call.
The default value is: -1.</preference_description>
