      <preference_description>If the item revision of a part features several BOM View Revisions and you create an occurrence of it within an assembly, the native behavior of Teamcenter is to use the first BOM View Revision type found.
To define a specific list of BOM View Types used in Teamcenter (for leaf node Parts only), create a new variable within CATIA_PSE_alternate_preferred_bv in Teamcenter Preferences.
The first type listed becomes the most preferred one. For example:

CATIA_PSE_alternate_preferred_bv=
newView1
newView2
newView3

A blank line marks the end of the list.
The list is sorted in order of preference, i.e., the first type displayed in the list is the most preferred one.
If the CATIA_PSE_alternate_preferred_bv variable is not defined, Teamcenter uses the first BOM View Revision type found.</preference_description>
