      <preference_description>Enables or disables data compression during remote import operations. For data compression to be employed between two Multi-Site Collaboration sites, both sites must set this preference to True to enable compression, and both sites must specify the same compression type by setting the IDSM_Compression_type preference. The recommendation is to set this legacy feature to FALSE. Must be set to FALSE if TcXML payload is enabled.
Valid Values:
TRUE - Enables compression at the site during remote import operations.
FALSE - Disables data compression during remote import operations.</preference_description>
