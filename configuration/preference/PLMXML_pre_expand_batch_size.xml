      <preference_description>Sets batch size for each single expansion of a structure prior to running the PLM XML expand operation. Structures that are a target for export can be fully expanded prior to their export step, which provides a performance improvement.
However, there are memory concerns with large structures whereby a full expansion may take more than the available memory of the system. This preference sets a limit. Values must be greater than 0. The smaller the batch size, the more likely that the value set in the PLMXML_pre_expand_max_line_limit preference will not be exceeded but at the cost of less performance gain.
Valid Values:
Accepts any integer value greater than 0.</preference_description>
