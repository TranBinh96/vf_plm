      <preference_description>Defines which attachment lines should be included in the attachments table in the right hand side section in the Custom view in the Manufacturing Process Planner (MPP) application.
The lines are filtered by object type and relation type. The asterisk character &apos;*&apos; can be used for either type to specify that all types are valid.
Each value specifies an inclusion condition. All lines that meet the condition of at least one value are included.
Valid values are the internal object and relation type names, separated by the semicolon character &apos;;&apos;: &quot;object_type;relation_type&quot;.
Examples:
&quot;MSWord;IMAN_MEWorkInstruction&quot;: all MS Word documents that are attached as Work Instruction
&quot;Text;*&quot;: all Text attachments
&quot;*;IMAN_specification&quot;: all attachments that are attached as Specification</preference_description>
