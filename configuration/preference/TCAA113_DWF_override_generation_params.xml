      <preference_description>Through this option it is possible to drive the behavior for DWF generation via PLOT command. 
Possible values:
0 - current page setup settings are used to generate DWF file without forcing any specific option.
1 - TCAA overrides current page setup forcing its own settings: plot is centered, scaled to fit to paper and the plot area is set to extents (Default).
It is possible to configure the plotter to be used to generate the DWF on a per-drawing base by setting a custom property called as TCAA_PC3_FOR_DWF whose value indicates the PC3 file to be used for plottting to DWF. By default &quot;DWF6 ePlot.pc3&quot; is used. 		</preference_description>
