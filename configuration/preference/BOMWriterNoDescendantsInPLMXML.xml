               <preference name="BOMWriterNoDescendantsInPLMXML" type="String" array="false" disabled="false" protectionScope="Site" envEnabled="false">
      <preference_description>Used with the bomwriter utility. Controls export of descendants (children and grandchildren) of selected BOM lines when Teamcenter lifecycle visualization or NX is launched from the Teamcenter rich client.
This preference determines whether the bomwriter utility generates PLM XML files which include descendants of the selected BOM lines.
Set this preference to TRUE (suppressing descendants) if the application for which the PLM XML file is intended supports navigating Teamcenter structures (such as NX).
If the file is intended for other applications (such as Teamcenter lifecycle visualization mockup) you may want to include descendents as they cannot load substructures on demand.
Valid Values:
TRUE - Descendents of selected BOM lines are not exported in the PLM XML file, and are not displayed in Teamcenter lifecycle visualization or NX.
FALSE - Descendents of selected BOM lines are exported in the PLM XML file, and are displayed in Teamcenter lifecycle visualization or NX.</preference_description>
