      <preference_description>Through this option it is possible specify a custom file name pattern to be applied for file renaming.
The value of this option is taken into consideration only if custom file renaming is enabled (i.e. TCAA_file_rename is set to 1 and TCAA_file_name_rule is set to 2).
The file name pattern consists of any literal text string(s) combined with one or more of the following tokens: ${MFK}, ${Item.item_id}, ${Item.object_name}, ${Item.object_desc}, ${ItemRevision.object_name}, ${ItemRevision.object_desc} and ${OriginalFileName}.
The file name pattern must not include the file extension.
Example: ${OriginalFileName}-${Item.object_name}
The default value of the preference is the empty string. In this case, the file name is retained as equal to the original file name.</preference_description>
