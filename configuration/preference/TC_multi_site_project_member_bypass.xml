      <preference_description>Determines the assignment rule to a defined project for objects replicated during an import operation to a remote site.
Valid values are: 
* true: The replicated object is assigned to the defined project regardless of whether the importing user is a project member. This is the default value. 
* false: The replicated object is assigned to the defined project if the importing user is a privileged project member. If the importing user is a regular project member then TC_project_validate_condition preference determines the project assignment on replicated object.</preference_description>
