               <preference name="TC_Volume_FilesPerDir_Check_Interval" type="Integer" array="false" disabled="false" protectionScope="Site" envEnabled="false">
      <preference_description>Specifies the interval (in seconds) at which the volume subdirectory should be checked for its maximum file limit.
This option is only valid when the preference  TC_Volume_Max_Files_Per_Dir is set to a value greater than 0.
Very low values can affect the performance of the system.
High values can affect the accuracy of TC_Volume_Max_Files_Per_Dir, so new sub-directories could get created much later than when the file limit has been reached.</preference_description>
