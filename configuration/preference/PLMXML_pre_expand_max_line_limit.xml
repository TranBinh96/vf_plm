      <preference_description>Sets the maximum number of lines in a structure that are to be expanded prior to running the PLM XML expand operation. Structures that are a target for export can be fully expanded prior to their export step, which provides a performance improvement.
However, there are memory concerns with large structures whereby a full expansion may take more than the available memory of the system. This preference sets a limit.
Valid Values:
0 - No lines are pre-expanded.
-1 - There is no limit on the number of lines to pre-expand.</preference_description>
