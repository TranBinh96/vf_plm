      <preference_description>Manages the visibility of workflow templates in the &quot;New Process&quot; panel of the Workflow application in the rich client.
Valid Values:
* any : The &quot;All&quot; option is pre-selected in the &quot;All/Assigned&quot; radio button group, which means that all templates are listed.
* Assigned: The &quot;Assigned&quot; option is pre-selected in the &quot;All/Assigned&quot; radio button group, which means that only the templates assigned to the group and selected target object type are listed.  This is the default value.
* none: The options &quot;All/Assigned&quot; are not visible. Furthermore, only the templates assigned to the group and selected target object type are displayed (behaviour similar to the &quot;Assigned&quot; option). When no templates are assigned for the target group/type, the displayed list is empty. If no object was selected when initiating the workflow, all the templates assigned to the group are listed.

Process templates assigned to a group and a target object type are defined through the &quot;Process designer-&gt;Edit-&gt;Template Filter&quot; command.</preference_description>
