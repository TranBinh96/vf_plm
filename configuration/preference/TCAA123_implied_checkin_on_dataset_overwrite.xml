      <preference_description>Through this option it is possible to configure TCAA in order to automatically check in to Teamcenter each dataset version created during overwrite operation. 
If the user requests to keep the dataset as checked out at the end of the overwrite operation through the check-in status in save table (or if a save silent operation is executed) and implied check-in is enabled, the dataset version created during the overwrite operation is checked in to Teamcenter and then the dataset is checked out again immediately afterwards. 
The option chosen for this preference has consequences on showed behavior in case of cancel checkout operation.
Possible values:
0 - do not force check in of each dataset version (Default) 
1 - perform implicit check in at each dataset overwrite operation</preference_description>
