      <preference_description>Specifies if a proximity search of a selected subassembly considers the components of the subassembly.
Valid Values:
true - The proximity search includes the selected subassembly and all its components as targets.
false - The proximity search includes only the selected subassembly as the target, not any of its components. For example, use this setting if you want to search for parts in the vicinity of geometry at the assembly level (for example, in the case of wire harnesses).</preference_description>
