      <preference_description>Determines whether to display the Action Rules tab in the Business Modeler IDE application. Use this tab to configure canned methods. These methods were moved to the Extensions Rules tab during Teamcenter 2005. If your site created custom canned methods, however, these custom methods cannot be converted to extension rules without implementation details such as function name, library, and so on, for creating an extension. Thus action rules and the Action Rules tab are still supported.
Valid Values:
ON - Suppresses the Action Rules tab in the Business Modeler IDE application.
OFF - Does not suppress the Action Rules tab in the Business Modeler IDE application.</preference_description>
