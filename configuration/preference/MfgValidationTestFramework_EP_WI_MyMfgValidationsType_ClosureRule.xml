      <preference_description>Defines the closure rule the Manufacturing Validation Test Framework will use before executing the validation tests.
The format of this preference is as follows: &quot;MfgValidationTestFramework_&lt;ClientIdentifier&gt;_&lt;ValidationTestSuiteTypeName&gt;_ClosureRule&quot;
&quot;ClientIdentifier&quot; is a unique client identifier that communicates with the Mfg Validation Test Framework.
&quot;ValidationTestSuiteTypeName&quot; must match the -type argument used during the &apos;install_callback&apos; for a Validation Test Suite.
The value is  the name of a Closure Rule.
This closure rule is associated with all the manufacturing test suites of this type. This closure rule will be run by the Mfg Test Framework before executing a Validation Test Suite.
This is a closure rule that is relevant across all validation test suites within a registered type.  Of course, each Mfg Validation Test suite can do any further traversal refinements within its own implementation.</preference_description>
