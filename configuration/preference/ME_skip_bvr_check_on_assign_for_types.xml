      <preference_description>Defines the list of item types for which the BOM View Revision (BVR) check will be skipped.
BVR check is necessary to assign top line of BOM structure to BOP structure, and it ensures that the assigned BOM line behaves like a consumed line.
This preference is recommended in special case to skip BVR check on certain types of lines to prevent access rights problem. 
Valid values are Teamcenter type internal names. For each type defined in the list, its sub types will be also included.
Teamcenter needs to be restarted for any value change to take effect.
By default the list is empty.</preference_description>
