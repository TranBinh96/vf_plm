               <preference name="ME_translation_tolerance" type="Double" array="false" disabled="false" protectionScope="Site" envEnabled="false">
      <preference_description>Defines the tolerance value (in millimeters) under which small variations in the translation section of a transform are considered equal. This value is used to normalize translation vectors to the closest integer (floor). For example, if the part is moved from 1.11 to 1.12 and this preference is set to 0.1, the calculation is as follows:floor (1.11/0.1)=11 and floor (1.12/0.1)=11Because these results are equal (11), the positions are not flagged as different. Lowering the preference value to .01 results in the following calculation:floor (1.11/0.01)=111 and floor (1.12/0.01)=112These results are no longer equal meaning that the translation from 1.11 to 1.12 constitutes two different positions.
Valid Values:
Accepts a double value representing a millimeter amount.</preference_description>
