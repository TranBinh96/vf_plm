               <preference name="NX0MotionSim_saveas_pattern" type="String" array="false" disabled="false" protectionScope="Site" envEnabled="false">
      <preference_description>Defines the pattern string of the name of new NX0MotionSim dataset object during a &quot;Save As&quot; operation. 
The value may contain text and also refer to the content of some of the object&apos;s properties using the &quot;${PropertyName}&quot; format, where &quot;PropertyName&quot; is either &quot;ItemID&quot;, &quot;RevisionID&quot; or &quot;UserText&quot;. The existing dataset name is expected to match this pattern. If the existing dataset name does not match the pattern, the new dataset name will not follow this pattern. 
Once an original dataset name is matched against the pattern, the new dataset name is generated by replacing the &quot;${ItemID}&quot; and &quot;${RevisionID}&quot; with the new revision and Item ID in the pattern, and all occurrences of &quot;${UserData}&quot; with whatever text they matched in the original name. 
As a result, the new name is used for saving the new dataset. 

Let us consider the example of a value &quot;${UserText}-${ItemID}/${RevisionID}&quot; where: 
* &quot;${UserText}&quot; is intended to be the name of the dataset, and 
* the minus sign is literal text. 
Suppose a user is saving the Item Revision &quot;001234/B&quot; to the Item Revision &quot;002345/A&quot;. 
Since &quot;${UserText}&quot; in the pattern matches any string, a dataset of name &quot;fea-001234/B&quot; or &quot;NX0MotionSim-001234/B&quot; would also match the pattern. 
However, a dataset of name &quot;NX0MotionSim_001234/B&quot; would not match the pattern because the minus sign is required. 
Likewise, a dataset of name &quot;NX0MotionSim-001235/B&quot; would not match the pattern because the Item ID is incorrect. 
Using the example above, the dataset would be saved as &quot;NX0MotionSim-002345/A&quot;.</preference_description>
