      <preference_description>Defines the remote sites that are permitted to distribute system administration data to the local site. This enforces site-level security; if a remote site is not defined in this preference, that site cannot perform distributed system administration functions that affect the local site. This is the first preference to be checked whenever a remote site tries to send system administration data to the local site. If this initial check results in a rejection of the request, the other distributed system administration preferences are not checked.
