The hsm_capacity_alert utility estimates the capacities of the volumes and uses the values defined in this preference to send e-mail alerts when the primary tier capacity exceeds alert levels. Volumes residing on hosts not defined by this preference are ignored for HSM migration and the hsm_capacity_alert utility.
Valid Values:
Accepts multiple strings as values. Each string must be a valid host name on which primary tier volumes reside. If all primary tier volumes are managed by third-party HSM software, you can set this preference to ALL rather than listing the individual host names.</preference_description>
