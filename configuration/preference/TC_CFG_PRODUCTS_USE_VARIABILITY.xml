      <preference_description>Manually enforces or disables the evaluation of variability allocation statements if they exist for a given item revision.
Variability allocation statements allow Teamcenter to import only some of the values of a variant option family in a product. If you leave this
preference unset, Teamcenter dynamically determines this configuration setting. The performance of this dynamic configuration is impacted by the
value set for the PortalDesignContextProductItemQuery preference. You can view and manage variability allocation statements with the Product Configurator
or Platform Designer applications. Technically, variability allocation statements are specialized VariantExpression objects using the corresponding operator
code, for example, PS_variant_operator_assy_uses+BOM_variant_op_rhs_is_string = 1002. For more information about these objects, see the $TC_INCLUDE/bom/bom_tokens.h file.
If an item revision has variability allocation statements and their evaluation is not disabled, the Teamcenter variant configurators recognize only explicitly allocated
variant option values. Otherwise, they recognize all variant option values that exist on the declared variant option family revision.Setting this preference is recommended
but not required. If you are unsure, set this preference to TRUE.
