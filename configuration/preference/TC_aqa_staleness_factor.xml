      <preference_description>Deciding which appearances to check is along the lines of &quot;check those which have been queried most, and most recently, and which haven&apos;t been checked recently&quot;. Finding out which have been queried most is a simple matter of looking for the largest values of N, adjustment for &quot;most recently&quot; is done by dividing the stored value of N by the staleness decay factor once for every day since N was last incremented (so that the older the audit, the less interesting it is).</preference_description>
