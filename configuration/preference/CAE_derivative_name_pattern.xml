      <preference_description>Specifies the naming pattern with a counter for generating the names of each output structure during a &quot;derive&quot; operation in the CAE Manager.
The pattern can be specified as a combination of fixed strings in double quotes and keywords. The keywords are &quot;BASENAME&quot; (corresponding to the base name specified by the user when deriving) and N (digit). 
The pattern must contain both keywords only once. Fixed strings are optional and can appear more than once in double quotes.      
Examples of pattern are:
* BASENAME&quot;-Deck&quot;NNNN
* NNN&quot;-&quot;BASENAME&quot;-Deck&quot; 
* NNNN&quot;-&quot;BASENAME            
The default value is BASENAME&quot;-&quot;NNNN.</preference_description>
