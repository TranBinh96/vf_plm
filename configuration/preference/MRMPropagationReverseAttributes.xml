      <preference_description>Defines what attributes should be propagated in the opposite order.
By default, assembly attributes are propagated bottom-up: Starting from the Propagation-Start-Point the components are checked up to the root component to find specific attribute values. The first component closest to the Propagation-Start-Point provides the value.
All attributes listed in the preference behave in the opposite order: For these attributes, the system checks from the root component down the structure to the component with the Propagation-Start-Point. In this case, the value of the component closest to the root will be propagated to the assembly.
Valid values are all Classification attribute IDs.</preference_description>
