      <preference_description>Defines which Teamcenter types can be associated with the signal as a redundant signals (or frames) type. If this preference is not set, users can associate a signal to any Teamcenter object that can participate in a relation.
Valid Values:
Accepts multiple strings as values. Each string must be a valid Teamcenter type corresponding to the secondary object for the desired association. For example, to restrict valid redundants for a frame and its subtypes to Frame and its subtypes, and valid redundants for a signal and its subtypes to Signal and its subtypes, set the values as:
Frame:Frame
Signal:Signal</preference_description>
