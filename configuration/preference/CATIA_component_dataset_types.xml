      <preference_description>A non-CATIA dataset type (DirectModel for the .jt file, or CATwrl for a wrl file) must be defined within Teamcenter Preferences prior to loading the dataset. For example:
CATIA_component_dataset_types =
myDatasetType1
myDatasetType2
This list can be slightly different from what is used by the Integration. For instance,
- If the catiaV4 default dataset type (as defined in your catiman.properties) is not in the list, it is added at the beginning.
- If the CATPart dataset type already is at the beginning of the list, catiaV4 default dataset type is inserted at the second position.
- If the CATPart dataset type is not in the list, it is added at the beginning.
For each dataset type defined in the list, define the Named Reference to load by defining a new variable built within the dataset type name defined in the CATIA_component_dataset_typesvariable. For example:
myDatasetType1_component_named_reference=
myNamedReference
If this variable is not defined for a dataset type of the CATIA_component_dataset_types list, the first named reference found will be used for the Load process.</preference_description>
