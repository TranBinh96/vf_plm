      <preference_description>Determines how Teamcenter interprets the unit of measure for legacy transform data. Teamcenter and NX currently use meters for transform units of measure; legacy measurements were in inches or millimeters. This preference affects all data using legacy transforms which have no database-resident indication of the unit measurement with which they were stored.
This preference can be set using the preference name as an environment variable.
Valid Values:
Inches - Assumes transform data is measured in inches.
Millimeters - Assumes transform data is measured in millimeters.
Unknown - No assumption made. User has to set the valid value either Inches or Millimeters.</preference_description>
