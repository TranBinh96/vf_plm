      <preference_description>Specifies the delimiter for text file format. It is only used when TC_audit_file_format=0. Although it is not enforced, usually the delimiter is single character because some spreadsheet programs such as Excel do not allow multiple character delimiter. 
If the delimiter is changed to other than ^, the user also needs to manually modify the delimiter in the first line of TcAuditLog.txt.</preference_description>
