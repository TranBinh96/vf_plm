               <preference name="Ticket_Expiration_Resolution" type="Integer" array="false" disabled="false" protectionScope="Site" envEnabled="false">
      <preference_description>Indicates the resolution (minimum amount of time in seconds) before the FMS ticket expiration is changed.
Setting this value advances the computed expiration time up to the value set, and limits the change in expiration time by the resolution.
This value can be used to improve performance of browser client applications that render files stored in FMS such as thumbnails. 
This value should not be large and should not be larger than the normal ticket expiration intervals. 
If this value is not set, a default of 7200 seconds is used.</preference_description>
