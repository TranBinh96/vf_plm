Valid Values:
TRUE - Protected publication records are invisible, (that is, they do not exist for those users that do not have access). For remote sites running pre-V6.0 software, protected publication records are automatically invisible.
FALSE - Users at remote sites that do not have read access to a publication record see an Access Denied message in the object list window. Find Remote produces this message.</preference_description>
