               <preference name="TCDefaultKeepLimitByType" type="String" array="true" disabled="false" protectionScope="Site" envEnabled="false">
      <preference_description>Determines the number of sequences the system maintains for the specified business object as it is checked in and out of the database. Sequences are subrevisions of a business object that document the content of a revision during its evolution.
Checking out a business object increments the sequence ID. At checkin, the system automatically removes the oldest sequence when the limit specified with this preference is reached.
When an item revision is checked out, a new sequence is created. Therefore, when the number of item revisions sequences is defined as 1, the system keeps two versions during checkout.
When the object is checked in, the system purges sequences to comply with the keep limit.
Valid Values:
Accepts multiple string pairs as values. Each string must be a space-delineated pair consisting of a valid business object and a positive integer more than zero.
For example:
