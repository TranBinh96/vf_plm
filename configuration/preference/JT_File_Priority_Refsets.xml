      <preference_description>Determines the load order of NX reference sets contained within DirectModel files. NX reference sets enable you to display different geometry configurations within the context of a single assembly. DirectModel support of NX reference sets can take two forms:DirectModel datasets created prior to Teamcenter 8, which consist of multiple JT files named according to the available reference setsDirectModel datasets created using Teamcenter 8 or later,
which may consist of a single JT file that contains all of the information necessary to define the geometry configurations for each reference setValues specified for the JT_File_Priority_Refsets preference are case sensitive.By default, the JT_File_Priority_Refsets preference is applicable only for the viewers embedded within Teamcenter applications such as Structure Manager and My Teamcenter. For the Lifecycle Viewer to use the reference set loading order
specified with this preference, select the Teamcenter Reference Set settings take precedence check box in the Lifecycle Viewer 3D Loader Preferences.
Valid Values:
For DirectModel datasets created      For DirectModel datasets           For a mixture of DirectModel datasets
using Teamcenter 8 or later           created prior to Teamcenter 8      created using different releases
