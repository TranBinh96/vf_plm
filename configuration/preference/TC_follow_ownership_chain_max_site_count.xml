      <preference_description>Sets a limit on the number of sites that are queried before a replica&apos;s owner is designated as unknown. When the site known as the owning site returns a new owning site, the report function queries the new owning site for the replica&apos;s state. This activity continues until the owning site returns the replica&apos;s state or the value set in the preference is reached. When the limit is reached the function checks the TC_on_demand_sync_broadcast_mode preference to determine whether to use broadcast mode or to designate the ownership as unknown.
Valid Values:
No limit - Specifies Multi-Site shall continue to query for the replicas owner until all known sites are queried.</preference_description>
