      <preference_description>Sets the directory for temporarily storing data during import and export. If not set, the current working directory is used to store data during import and export.
Valid Values:
Full OS path to the directory.This string can be a single line value, for example:
TC_transfer_area=
/tmp
This string can also contain multiple lines to support a heterogeneous site. In this case, Teamcenter uses the first valid value for the platform (UNIX or Windows). Validity is determined by the presence of a backslash (\). For example, where the Windows path uses C: as the drive letter, the preference is set for both UNIX and Windows as:
TC_transfer_area=
/tmp
c:\temp
UNC paths are specified with a triple backslash. When the Windows path is specified in UNC format, the preference for both UNIX and Windows is defined as:
TC_transfer_area=
/tmp
\\\hostx\share_area</preference_description>
