      <preference_description>Enables strict hierarchical representation of programs and projects where a program can have projects.
Valid values are:
* true: Users can only select programs in the user session. The program selected in user session and the projects under that program will be displayed for project assignment
* false: All programs and projects are available for selection in the user session. All  programs and projects are displayed for project assignment. This is the default value.

Note: It is recommended that data assigned to programs and projects be migrated to hierarchical configuration before setting this preference to true.</preference_description>
