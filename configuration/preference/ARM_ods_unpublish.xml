      <preference_description>Activates the performance monitoring of the Multi-Site Collaboration unpublish object function in both the Teamcenter server and the ODS service.
For client processes, the transaction reports the duration of time required to perform an unpublish object operation on the selected objects.
For ODS processes, the transaction reports the time required to remove the publication records for the objects and to report operation status back to the
requesting client process.
Operation status or error code metrics can also be reported for both client and server processes.
Valid Values:
* ON: Enables performance monitoring of the Multi-Site Collaboration unpublish object function in both the Teamcenter server and the ODS service.
* OFF: Suppresses performance monitoring of the Multi-Site Collaboration unpublish object function in both the Teamcenter server and the ODS service.</preference_description>
