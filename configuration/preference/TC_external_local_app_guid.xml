      <preference_description>Defines the GUID (general unique identifier) of the home application, in this case, of Teamcenter. When a link is created, the system submits its GUID to the remote application so a bi-directional link can be created. This preference is set by the system during the Remote workflow installation procedure.
Valid Values:
During the Remote workflow installation procedure, the GUID can be either manually entered or automatically generated by the system. Siemens PLM Software recommends autogenerating the GUID.</preference_description>
