      <preference_description>Determines which of two possible relationships to use for the revisions in the Progression tree.
Valid Values:
TC_based_on - Displays the problem/solution relationship where the selected revision is the solution revision. The problem revision is shown as a parent revision. This relationship can only be displayed in the Progression tree if the selected revision is part of a change process. Use this setting if your site is not using change management for BOM tracking.

EC_affected_to_problem_relation - Displays the based on relationship where the revision upon which the selected revision was based is shown as the parent revision. This relationship is not dependent on the selected revision being part of a change process. Use this setting if your site is using change management for BOM tracking.</preference_description>
