               <preference name="TC_Default_Solve_Type" type="Integer" array="false" disabled="false" protectionScope="Site" envEnabled="false">
      <preference_description>Defines the default solve type value that Teamcenter uses when setting effectivity configurations.
Valid values are
1 - Mismatch. Conditions that do not match the solve criteria.
2 - Explicit. Conditions that explicitly match the solve criteria.
4 - Coprime. Conditions that may match the solve criteria. The term coprime means the condition depends on variant option families that are not present in the criteria.
8 - True. Conditions that always satisfy the solve criteria because they are equivalent to the Boolean constant TRUE.
16 - False. Conditions that never satisfy the solve criteria because they are equivalent to the Boolean constant FALSE.
32 - Condition. Conditions that are nonconstant because they are not equivalent to the Boolean constants TRUE or FALSE.
64 - Error check. Conditions that return an error in the solve process. Configurations using this mode should never return any data.
128 - No condition. No conditions. Finds objects that support configuration conditions but do not have one.
256 - No configuration behavior. Objects that do not support configuration behavior in the solve process.
512 - Invert. Inverts the filter results.</preference_description>
