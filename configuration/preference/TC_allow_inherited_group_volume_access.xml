      <preference_description>Allows a group to inherit access to a Teamcenter volume from its parent group. That is, if a group is explicitly granted volume access, and this preference is set to a nonzero number, that group&apos;s subgroups (and the subgroup&apos;s children) are implicitly granted access to that volume.
Inherited access applies to all volumes including default local volumes, also known as store and forward volumes.
Valid Values:
0 - Does not allow groups to inherit access to a volume from its parent group.
Single positive integer - Allows groups to inherit access to a volume from its parent group.</preference_description>
