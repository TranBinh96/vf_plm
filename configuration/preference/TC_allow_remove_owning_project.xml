      <preference_description>Allows the removal of a project from the owning_project property of the workspace object in which the object is assigned if the preference value is set to true. The user must create this preference; it does not exist in Teamcenter by default. If the preference does not exist or has a value of false, the project cannot be removed even though the project can be removed from the project_list property.
If you use the autoAssignToProject extension, you must create this preference and set its value to true to allow automatic project assignment.
Valid values are:
* true: Allows removal of a project from the owning_project property.
* false: Prevents removal of a project from the owning_project property. This is the default value.</preference_description>
