      <preference_description>Frees up the memory to the OS by forcing a hard full reload of Active Workspace client. Based on a number of user operations such as navigating
to a new location or selecting a new tab in the work area will increment an internally managed counter. When the counter reaches the value supplied by this preference then a hard full reload of AW is performed. The internal count will be reset to 0 and the whole process will be repeated.
Note: This preference only applies to the MS Internet Explorer (IE) Browser.
Valid values are:
* Less than or equal to 0 : Results in no Hard Reloads. -1 is the default value.
* Greater than 0 : Results in Hard Reloads.  A value of 20 is recommended initially, and increased or decreased based on browser memory consumption for common use cases.</preference_description>
