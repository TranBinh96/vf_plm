      <preference_description>Configures the Access Manager delegation for relation object BO to primary or secondary object.
Note that primary or secondary is just string literal to indicate if access is delegated to either primary or secondary.
The following formats are supported:
relationBOName1:primary
relationBOName2:secondary
myRelationBOName
For value with just relationBOName, delegation would be to primary object, this is same as putting entry like relationBOName:primary.</preference_description>
