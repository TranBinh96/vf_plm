      <preference_description>Determines whether a Snapshot folder is created after a baseline operation is performed. The new Snapshot folder is attached to the baseline revision.
Teamcenter only creates Snapshot folders for imprecise baselines. If you create a precise baseline, it does not create a snapshot folder even if this preference is set to 1. 
Valid Values:
0 - A Snapshot folder is not created after a baseline is created.
1 - A Snapshot folder is created after a baseline is created.</preference_description>
