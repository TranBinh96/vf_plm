      <preference_description>Teamcenter can determine whether a product structure should be fully or partially expanded, depending on the quantity of server memory used. This preference specifies a percentage of free server memory, which (if exceeded) causes Teamcenter to limit structure expansion to conserve memory. It is effective for structure expansions initiated by the bomwriter and plmxml_export utilities, but not for expansions initiated in Structure Manager.
Valid Values:
Accepts a single integer in the range 0 to 100 as its value. If set to 0, there no limit on the use of available system memory for expansion.The following examples show the effect of different settings:
Example 1:
Total system memory - 4 GB 
Total available system memory - 2.5 GB
BOM_enable_mem_mgt_probability_percent= 50
Total system memory used for BOM expansion = 1.25 GB approximately
Example 2:
Total system memory - 4 GB
Total available system memory - 2.5 GB
BOM_enable_mem_mgt_probability_percent= 25
Total system memory used for BOM expansion = 0.625 GB (625 MB) approximately
The formula it utilizes to calculate the total system memory used is:
(BOM_enable_mem_mgt_probability_percent X Available System Memory)</preference_description>
