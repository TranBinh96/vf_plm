      <preference_description>Specifies whether derived BOM edits are created for children at all lower levels when a BOM edit is created for the parent.
Derived BOM edits have the effect of rendering the children in same color as the parent in the BOM panel, regardless of whether the children have been changed.
Valid Values:
* true: Derived BOM edits are created for children at all lower levels, but at the expense of performance.
* false: No derived BOM edits are created, producing better performance. This is the default value.</preference_description>
