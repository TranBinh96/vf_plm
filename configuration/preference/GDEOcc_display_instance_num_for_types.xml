KBL (KabelBaumListe - wire harness description list) is a standard for wiring models that enhances the STEP AP212 model. The KBL object model provides high-level components that represent wires, harnesses, and parts in a vehicle that hosts the harness. This model is a subset of AP212 model and models represent wire harness data in a similar way. If KBL functionality has been installed, the following KBL type names must be defined.
