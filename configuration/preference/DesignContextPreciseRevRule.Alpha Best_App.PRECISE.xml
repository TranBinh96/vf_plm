      <preference_description>Allows the search of Product Structure based on certain revision rules which have the special clauses for which there are no Appearance Sets available, whereas Appearance Sets are available for a revision rule which have all the clauses leaving the Special Clause e.g. &quot;Precise&quot; Clause. Please make sure that a stripped down version of Revision Rule exists and is used for creating an Appearance Set. Here in this example &quot;Alpha Best_App&quot; is a stripped down version of revision Rule &quot;Alpha Best&quot;, which has all clauses of &quot;Alpha Best&quot; other than the &quot;Precise&quot; clause. Syntax: DesignContextPreciseRevRule.&lt;RuleName&gt;.Suffix. Supported suffix constants are: &quot;.PRECISE&quot;</preference_description>
